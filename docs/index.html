        <p class="whitespace-normal font-mono">
            For my final project, I decided to virtualize the game, Chopsticks, in order to combine the keyframing
            techniques I learned from this class with concepts from my artificial intelligence course (CSCE 420). 
            After starting the program, the user/player uses the keyboard to input what hands they are using and targeting.
            Once the player makes a move, the computer opponent uses the minimax search algorithm to decide what move to make. 
            In order to conserve resources, I limit the search to a depth of 3 by default, but this can be changed when constructing the bot class.
            The computer is still challenging to defeat with this limitation, even after going first.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-black font-mono">Rules of the Game</h2>
        <p class="whitespace-normal font-mono">
            There are several variants of Chopsticks. I simply implimented the rules that I am most accustomed to playing with.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="whitespace-normal font-bold font-mono">
            Here's how the game works:
        </p>
        <p class="whitespace-normal font-mono">
            Each player starts the game holding up only thier index finger on each hand.
            On thier turn, a player taps their opponent's hand. 
            The opponent raises as many fingers on their tapped hand as were raised on the hand that the acting player tapped it with.
            If the number of fingers they need to raise exceeds the five fingers they have on their hand, they start back over at one.
            If an attacked hand ends up with exactly five fingers raised, that player must lower all the fingers on that hand. It can no longer attack or be attacked.
            The most controversy (in my experience) comes with the next rule: 
            instead of attacking, for their turn, a player with one inactive hand and a hand with an even number of raised fingers may bump their hands together and evenly divide the raised fingers between their hands, reviving their dead hand.
            When both of a player's hands are rendered inactive, they lose.

            First, I used my submission from the keyframing assignment as a starting point.
